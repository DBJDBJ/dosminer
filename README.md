### C WIN32 Console App

Original was written in C. It compileth and worketh using Borland Turbo C and its console library. Alternative was probably supposed to use [Stroustrup graph](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/Graphics/). Which is a mistake as that is cpp not c. MSVC WIN32 console was never tried. Probably it only compileth.
